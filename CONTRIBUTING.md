## Contributing

We'd love your help! Thanks for caring about the book.

### The purpose of the book

The book is intended to serve both as a guide to getting started with Forge and Cast, as well as a quick reference for both of these tools.

The book is split into some major chapters:

- Getting Started, which is intended to walk people through installing Foundry
- Forge Guide, which is intended to be a complete-ish tour of Forge
- Cast Guide, which is similarly intended to be a tour of Cast
- Additional Guides, which is a collection of other various topics such as CI, shell autocompletions
- Reference, which is intended to contain complete reference sheets on Forge and Cast, as well as related tools

Within each chapter there are multiple sections and subsections.

For this particular book, it is OK to assume some familiarity with Solidity and general concepts from other smart contract toolchains, such as Hardhat and Truffle.

### Code of Conduct

The book follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).
