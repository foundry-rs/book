# Limitations

Adapting existing EVM contracts to work within a zkEVM environment requires significant modifications to their underlying code. These changes are primarily due to the fundamental [incompatibility](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/era-vm) between EVM and zkEVM and, as such, cannot be ignored or circumvented in any way. These constraints are usually enforced by the zkEVM's [bootloader](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/zksync-evm/bootloader), and can lead to panics if ignored.

Here, we enlist the more common limitations and their mitigation strategies, if any.
