## Advanced Testing

Forge comes with a number of advanced testing methods:

- [Table Testing](/forge/advanced-testing/table-testing)
- [Fuzz Testing](/forge/advanced-testing/fuzz-testing)
- [Invariant Testing](/forge/advanced-testing/invariant-testing)
- [Differential Testing](/forge/advanced-testing/differential-ffi-testing)

In the future, Forge will also support these:

- [Symbolic Execution](#)
- [Mutation Testing](#)

Each chapter dives into what problem the testing methods solve, and how to apply them to your own project.
