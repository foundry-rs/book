## `setEnv`

### Signature

```solidity
function setEnv(string calldata key, string calldata value) external;
```

### Description

Set an environment variable `key=value`.

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> Environment variables set by a process are only accessible by itself and its child
> processes. Thus, calling `setEnv` will only modify environment variables of the currently running
> `forge` process, and won't affect the shell (`forge`'s parent process), i.e., the they won't persist
> after the `forge` process exit.

### Tips

- The environment variable key can't be empty.
- The environment variable key can't contain the equal sign `=` or the NUL character `\0`.
- The environment variable value can't contain the NUL character `\0`.

### Examples

```solidity
string memory key = "hello";
string memory val = "world";
cheats.setEnv(key, val);
```
