## Foundry-ZKsync Book

**Foundry-ZKsync is a smart contract development toolchain for ZKsync**, built upon [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

Foundry-ZKsync manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command line and via Solidity scripts.

> ⚠️ **Alpha Stage:** The project is in alpha, so you might encounter issues. For more information or reporting bugs, please visit the [Foundry-ZKsync GitHub repository](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync).
