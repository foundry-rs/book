#### How do I switch between versions?

Easily manage your installations with:

```sh
foundryup --use <version>
```

e.g.

```sh
foundryup --use nightly
foundryup --use stable
foundryup --use 0.3.0
```

#### How do I configure `foundry-toolchain`?

The `foundry-toolchain` GitHub Action will use the latest `stable` release by default.

If you would prefer to use a different release you can set the `version` key:

```yml
- name: Install Foundry
  uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
  with:
    version: <version>
```

e.g.

```yml
- name: Install Foundry
  uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
  with:
    version: nightly
```

#### I prefer using nightly builds.

You are still able to receive the latest `nightly` builds by running `foundryup --install nightly`

**Be cautious â€” nightly builds may include breaking changes that are difficult to debug without context.**
