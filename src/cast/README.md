## Overview of `cast`

`cast` is Foundry's command-line tool for performing Ethereum RPC calls. You can make smart contract calls, send transactions, or retrieve any type of chain data - all from your command-line!

### How to use `cast`

To use `cast`, use the `cast` keyword followed by a subcommand:

```bash
$ cast <subcommand>
```

#### Examples

Let's use `cast` to retrieve the total supply of the DAI token:

```bash
{{#include ../output/cast/cast-call:all}}
```

`cast` also provides many convenient subcommands, such as for decoding calldata:

```bash
{{#include ../output/cast/cast-4byte-decode:all}}
```
