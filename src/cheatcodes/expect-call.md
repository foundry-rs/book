## `expectCall`

```solidity
function expectCall(address where, bytes calldata data) external;
```

### Description

Expects at least one call to address `where`, where the call data either strictly or loosely matches `data`.

When a call is made to `where` the call data is first checked to see if it matches in its entirety with `data`. If not, the call data is checked to see if there is a partial match, with the match starting at the first byte of the call data.

If the test terminates without the call being made, the test fails.

### Examples

Expect that `transfer` is called on a token `MyToken`:

```solidity
address alice = address(10);
cheats.expectCall(
  address(token), abi.encodeCall(token.transfer, (alice, 10))
);
token.transfer(alice, 10);
// [PASS]
```
