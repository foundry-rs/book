## `getBlockNumber`

### Signature

```solidity
function getBlockNumber() external view returns (uint256 timestamp);
```

### Description

Gets the current `block.number`. This is useful in cases where `vm.roll` along with `--via-ir` compilation is used, as `block.number` is assumed to be a constant during a transaction. This means that on every spark test, multiple calls to `block.number` would get optimized to just returning a constant value, instead of actually accessing the current `block.number`. `vm.getBlockNumber()` avoids this optimization and returns the current `block.number`.

### Examples

```solidity
uint256 height = vm.getBlockNumber();
assertEq(height, uint256(block.number));
vm.roll(10);
assertEq(vm.getBlockNumber(), 10);
```
