## `getBlockTimestamp`

### Signature

```solidity
function getBlockTimestamp() external view returns (uint256 timestamp);
```

### Description

Gets the current `block.timestamp`. This is useful in cases where `vm.warp` along with `--via-ir` compilation is used, as `block.timestamp` is assumed to be a constant during a transaction. This means that in every forge test, multiple calls to `block.timestamp` would get optimized to just returning a constant value, instead of actually accessing the current `block.timestamp`. `vm.getBlockTimestamp()` avoids this optimization and returns the current `block.timestamp`.

### Examples

```solidity
assertEq(vm.getBlockTimestamp(), 1, "timestamp should be 1");
vm.warp(10);
assertEq(vm.getBlockTimestamp(), 10, "warp failed");
```
