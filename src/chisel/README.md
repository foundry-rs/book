## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

The `chisel` binary can be used both within and outside of a Foundry project.
If the binary is executed in a Foundry project root, Chisel will inherit the project's configuration options.

Officially we do not support chisel for ZKsync related operations.
