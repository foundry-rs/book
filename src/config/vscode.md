## Integrating with VSCode

You can get Solidity support for Visual Studio Code by installing the [VSCode Solidity extension](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity).

To make the extension play nicely with Foundry, you may have to tweak a couple of things.

### 1. Remappings

You may want to place your remappings in `remappings.txt`.

If they are already in `foundry.toml`, copy them over and use `remappings.txt` instead. If you just use the autogenerated remappings that Foundry provides, run `forge remappings > remappings.txt`.

### 2. Dependencies

You may have to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` for the extension to find your dependencies:

```json
{
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "src",
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "lib"
}
```

Where `src` is the source code directory and `lib` is your dependency directory.

### 3. Formatter

To enable the built-in formatter that comes with Foundry to automatically format your code on save, you can add the following settings to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[solidity]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "JuanBlanco.solidity" 
  },
  "solidity.formatter": "forge",
}
```

To configure the formatter settings, refer to the [Formatter](../reference/config/formatter.md) reference.

### 4. Solc Version

Finally, it is recommended to specify a Solidity compiler version:

```json
"solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.17"
```

To get Foundry in line with the chosen version, add the following to your `default` profile in `foundry.toml`.

```toml
solc = "0.8.17"
```
