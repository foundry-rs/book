# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Foxar!

There are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Rust or are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.

No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

This document will help you get started. Do not let the document intimidate you. It should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.

The [dev Telegram](https://t.me/foxar_rs) is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this guide.

First check the [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/foxar-rs/foxar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
