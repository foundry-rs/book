## Advanced Testing

Forge comes with a number of advanced testing methods:

- [Differential Testing](./differential-ffi-testing.md)
- [Fuzz Testing](./fuzz-testing.md)
- [Invariant Testing](./invariant-testing.md)

In the future, Forge will also support these:

- [Symbolic Execution](#)
- [Mutation Testing](#)

Each chapter dives into what problem the testing methods solve, and how to apply them to your own project.
