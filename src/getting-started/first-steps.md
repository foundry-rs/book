## First Steps with Foundry

This section provides an overview of the `forge` command line tool. We demonstrate how to create a new project, compile, and test it.

To start a new project with Foundry, use `forge init`:

```sh
$ forge init hello_foundry
```

Let's check out what `forge` generated for us:

```sh
$ cd hello_foundry
$ tree .
.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ds-test
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ Contract.sol
    â””â”€â”€ test
        â””â”€â”€ Contract.t.sol

6 directories, 7 files
```

We can build the project:

```sh
$ forge build
[â Š] Compiling...
[â ¢] Compiling 3 files with 0.8.10
[â †] Solc finished in 70.23ms
Compiler run successful
```

And run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
[â Š] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Running 1 test for src/test/Contract.t.sol:ContractTest
[PASS] testExample() (gas: 120)
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 725.84Âµs
```
