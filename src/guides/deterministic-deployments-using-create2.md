# Deterministic deployments using `CREATE2`

## Introduction

Enshrined into the EVM as part of the [Constantinople fork](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#constantinople) of 2019, `CREATE2` is an opcode that started its journey as [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014).
`CREATE2` allows you to deploy smart contracts to deterministic addresses, based on parameters controlled by the deployer.

As a result, it's often mentioned as enabling "counterfactual" deployments, where you can interact with an addresses that haven't been created yet because `CREATE2` guarantees known code can be placed at that address.

This is in contrast to the `CREATE` opcode, where the address of the deployed contract is a function of the deployer's nonce.
With `CREATE2`, you can use the same deployer account to deploy contracts to the same address across multiple networks, even if the address has varying nonces.

For the best user experience it is recommended to avoid having different addresses of the same deployment across different EVM chains.

## Getting started

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> This guide is intended to help you get started with configuring deterministic deployments using `CREATE2`.
> By default `new Counter{salt: salt}()` will use by default the deterministic deployer at [0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy).  
> A different deployer address can be configured by setting `create2_deployer` in `foundry.toml` or by using `--create2-deployer` argument.

## Configuring your `foundry.toml`

In order to reliably deploy to deterministic addresses we will need to make sure our bytecode stays the same. To do so configure our `foundry.toml` as follows:

```toml
[profile.default]
solc = "0.8.28"
evm_version = "cancun"
bytecode_hash = "none"
cbor_metadata = false
```

It is required to pin your `solc` (Solidity) version. It is generally recommended to use a recent version or, if preferred, the latest version.

Next, configure your `evm_version`. It is generally recommended to use the most recent hardfork but depending on your deployment targets this may need to use an older hardfork due to opcode incompatibilites.

By default the Solidity compiler appends the hash of the metadata file at end of the bytecode. This bytecode includes things like the compiler version and the ABI.

Since the source file hashes are included in the metadata file, even if a single byte of source files changes, the metadata hash changes too. That means, if we can compile a contract with given source files and the bytecode + the appended metadata hash are exactly the same as an on-chain contract, we can be sure that this is a byte-by-byte match of the same source files and the same compilation settings.

The metadata file may look something like this:

```json

By disabling the metadata as follows:

```toml
bytecode_hash = "none"
cbor_metadata = false
```

You are not including the metadata hash as part of the bytecode. This means that whilst your bytecode can now be deterministic you won't be able to have a [`full match`](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/full-vs-partial-match/#full-perfect-matches), only a [`partial match`](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/full-vs-partial-match/#partial-matches) when verifying your contracts. Depending on your requirements this may be acceptable.

If you are enabling the `optimizer` make sure your `optimizer_runs` stay consistent.

## Deploying the contract

When using Solidity's default `CREATE` where the new address of a contract is determined by taking the `hash` of the `sender`'s address and the `sender`'s `nonce`:

```ignore
new_contract_address = keccak256(rlp_encode([sender, nonce]))[12:]
```

```solidity
// Using the default CREATE opcode
Counter counter = new Counter();
```

Because the `nonce` can only be used a single time it on each chain it is an unreliable way of deploying to the same contract address.

Instead let's use `CREATE2`'s `salt` parameter.

The `salt` parameter in `CREATE2` is a key component that determines the final deployed contract address. It allows for flexibility and uniqueness in deterministic deployments. The address of the deployed contract is derived using the following formula:

```ignore
new_contract_address = keccak256(0xff ++ deployer ++ salt ++ keccak256(init_code))
```

```solidity
// Passing the `salt` parameter to the CREATE2 opcode
Counter counter = new Counter{salt: salt}();
```

- `0xff` is a fixed prefix ensuring uniqueness.
- `deployer` is the address executing the CREATE2 operation.
- `salt` is a 32-byte value chosen by the deployer.
- `keccak256(bytecode)` is the hash of the contract’s creation bytecode.

Given that `0xff` is fixed, the `deployer` is a deterministic deployer ([0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy)) and our bytecode is fixed we can use the `salt` parameter to fully control our new contract address.
