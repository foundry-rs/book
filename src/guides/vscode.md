## Integrating with VSCode

You can get Solidity support for Visual Studio Code by installing [the VSCode Solidity extension](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity).

To make the extension play nice with Foundry, you will need to place your remappings in `remappings.txt`. If they are already in `foundry.toml`, copy them over and use `remappings.txt` instead. If you just use the autogenerated remappings that Foundry provides, run `forge remappings > remappings.txt`.

If you use a non-standard project layout, you may have to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "src",
  "solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "lib"
}
```

Where `src` is the source code directory and `lib` is your dependency directory.

It is also recommended to specify a Solidity compiler version:

```json
"solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.10"
```

To get Foundry in line with the chosen version, add the following to your `default` profile in `foundry.toml`.

```toml
solc_version = "0.8.10"
```
