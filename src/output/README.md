## CLI Output

**This is auto-generated content** by [`scripts/gen_output.sh`](../../scripts/gen_output.sh), which uses the [projects](../../projects) in the repository root.

If the CLI output of either `spark` or `probe` has changed substantially, or you made changes to the projects, then you should run `./scripts/gen_output.sh` from the root of the repository.

Make sure that you have all of the submodules pulled by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

To use the output in here, refer to existing places that include CLI output from this folder, or [mdbook's documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mdbook.html) for more info.

### Why?

This has some benefits:

- We check that the code snippets we use actually compile
- We check that the commands in the book actually run
- If the output looks wrong, we might have detected a bug
- Sometimes the output of `probe` and `spark` change quite fast - in these cases, it is easier to run one command compared to manually changing every page
