## Cast

Cast performs Ethereum RPC calls, sends transactions, and decodes data from the command line. It's the Swiss Army knife for blockchain interaction.

Cast works both inside and outside a Foundry project.

### Key capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chain data** | Read blocks, transactions, logs, and account state |
| **Transactions** | Send transactions and interact with contracts |
| **Wallets** | Manage keys, sign messages, and verify signatures |
| **ABI encoding** | Encode/decode calldata, events, and function signatures |
| **Utilities** | Convert units, compute hashes, and manipulate data |

### Common workflows

```bash [Get the latest block number]
$ cast block-number
```

```bash [Read a contract's storage]
$ cast call $CONTRACT "balanceOf(address)" $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Send a transaction]
$ cast send $CONTRACT "transfer(address,uint256)" $TO $AMOUNT --private-key $KEY
```

```bash [Decode calldata]
$ cast 4byte-decode 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000...
```

```bash [Get an account's ETH balance]
$ cast balance $ADDRESS
```
