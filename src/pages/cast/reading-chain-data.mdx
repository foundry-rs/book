description: Query blockchain data with Cast — blocks, transactions, logs, and account state.
---

## Reading chain data

Cast queries any Ethereum-compatible chain via JSON-RPC. Set your RPC endpoint with `--rpc-url` or the `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable.

```bash
$ export ETH_RPC_URL=https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
```

### Blocks

:::code-group

```bash [Block number]
$ cast block-number
```

```bash [Block details]
$ cast block latest
```

```bash [Specific block]
$ cast block 18000000
```

```bash [Block field]
$ cast block latest --field timestamp
```

```bash [Base fee]
$ cast base-fee
```

:::

### Transactions

:::code-group

```bash [Transaction details]
$ cast tx $TX_HASH
```

```bash [Receipt]
$ cast receipt $TX_HASH
```

```bash [Status]
$ cast receipt $TX_HASH --field status
```

```bash [Gas used]
$ cast receipt $TX_HASH --field gasUsed
```

:::

### Account state

:::code-group

```bash [ETH balance]
$ cast balance $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Balance in ether]
$ cast balance $ADDRESS --ether
```

```bash [Nonce]
$ cast nonce $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Bytecode]
$ cast code $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Storage slot]
$ cast storage $ADDRESS 0
```

:::

### Contract calls

Call view functions without sending a transaction:

:::code-group

```bash [Call function]
$ cast call $CONTRACT "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Named output]
$ cast call $CONTRACT "name()(string)"
```

```bash [At block]
$ cast call $CONTRACT "totalSupply()(uint256)" --block 18000000
```

:::

### Logs and events

:::code-group

```bash [By event signature]
$ cast logs "Transfer(address indexed,address indexed,uint256)" --from-block 18000000
```

```bash [By address]
$ cast logs --address $CONTRACT --from-block 18000000 --to-block latest
```

```bash [Decode topics]
$ cast logs "Transfer(address,address,uint256)" --address $TOKEN
```

:::

### Chain info

:::code-group

```bash [Chain ID]
$ cast chain-id
```

```bash [Gas price]
$ cast gas-price
```

```bash [Estimate gas]
$ cast estimate $CONTRACT "transfer(address,uint256)" $TO $AMOUNT
```

:::

### ENS resolution

:::code-group

```bash [Name to address]
$ cast resolve-name vitalik.eth
```

```bash [Address to name]
$ cast lookup-address 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```
