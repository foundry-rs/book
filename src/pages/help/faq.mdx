## FAQ

Common questions about Foundry.

### General

#### What is Foundry?

Foundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum development written in Rust. It includes:
- **Forge** — Build, test, and deploy smart contracts
- **Cast** — Interact with the chain from the command line
- **Anvil** — Local Ethereum node for development
- **Chisel** — Interactive Solidity REPL

#### How do I install Foundry?

Use `foundryup`:

```bash
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
$ foundryup
```

See [Installation](/introduction/installation) for details.

#### How do I update Foundry?

Run `foundryup` again:

```bash
$ foundryup
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
$ foundryup --version nightly-abc123
```

#### How do I get help with a command?

All Foundry tools support `--help`:

```bash
$ forge --help
$ forge test --help
$ cast --help
$ anvil --help
$ chisel --help
```

See the [CLI reference](/reference/forge/forge) for full command docs.

### Forge

#### How do I run a specific test?

Use `--match-test`:

```bash
$ forge test --match-test test_Transfer
```

Use `--match-contract` for a specific contract:

```bash
$ forge test --match-contract TokenTest
```

#### How do I see console.log output?

Use verbosity level 2 or higher:

```bash
$ forge test -vv
```

#### Why are my tests slow?

Common causes:
1. **Forking without caching** — Enable fork caching with `--fork-cache`
2. **Too many fuzz runs** — Reduce `fuzz.runs` in `foundry.toml` for local development
3. **Large contracts** — Consider splitting tests into separate files

#### How do I debug a failing test?

Use the interactive debugger:

```bash
$ forge test --debug test_MyTest
```

Or increase verbosity to see the trace:

```bash
$ forge test --match-test test_MyTest -vvvv
```

See [Debugging](/forge/debugging) for more.

#### How do I fork mainnet in tests?

Set `--fork-url` or configure it in `foundry.toml`:

```bash
$ forge test --fork-url https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
```

Or in `foundry.toml`:

```toml
[profile.default]
fork_url = "https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc"
```

#### How do I run tests in parallel?

Tests run in parallel by default. To control parallelism:

```bash
$ forge test --jobs 4
```

Set to 1 for sequential execution (useful for debugging):

```bash
$ forge test --jobs 1
```

### Cast

#### How do I call a contract function?

Use `cast call` for read-only calls:

```bash
$ cast call $CONTRACT "balanceOf(address)" $ADDRESS
```

Use `cast send` for state-changing transactions:

```bash
$ cast send $CONTRACT "transfer(address,uint256)" $TO $AMOUNT --private-key $KEY
```

#### How do I decode transaction data?

Use `cast 4byte-decode`:

```bash
$ cast 4byte-decode 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000...
```

#### How do I convert between units?

Use `cast to-wei` and `cast from-wei`:

```bash
$ cast to-wei 1 ether
# 1000000000000000000

$ cast from-wei 1000000000000000000
# 1.000000000000000000
```

### Anvil

#### How do I get test ETH?

Anvil pre-funds 10 accounts with 10,000 ETH each. List them:

```bash
$ anvil
# Shows accounts and private keys on startup
```

#### How do I impersonate an account?

Start Anvil with auto-impersonation:

```bash
$ anvil --auto-impersonate
```

Or impersonate a specific account via RPC:

```bash
$ cast rpc anvil_impersonateAccount $ADDRESS
```

#### How do I reset the chain state?

Use the RPC method:

```bash
$ cast rpc anvil_reset
```

Or restart Anvil.

#### How do I mine blocks manually?

Disable auto-mining and mine manually:

```bash
$ anvil --no-mining
# In another terminal:
$ cast rpc anvil_mine 10  # Mine 10 blocks
```

### Chisel

#### How do I access my project's contracts?

Chisel automatically loads your project. Import and use contracts:

```solidity
➜ import {Counter} from "src/Counter.sol";
➜ Counter c = new Counter();
➜ c.increment();
```

#### How do I fork in Chisel?

Start with a fork:

```bash
$ chisel --fork-url https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
```

Or fork during a session:

```solidity
➜ !fork https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
```

#### How do I save my session?

Use the `!save` command:

```solidity
➜ !save my-session
```

Load it later:

```bash
$ chisel load my-session
```
