## Soldeer as a Package Manager

As explained [here](./dependencies), Foundry has been using git submodules to handle dependencies up until now. 

The need for a native package manager started to emerge as projects became more complex.

A new approach has been in the making, [soldeer.xyz](https://soldeer.xyz), which is a Solidity native dependency manager built in Rust and open sourced (check the repository [https://github.com/mario-eth/soldeer](https://github.com/mario-eth/soldeer)).

### Initialize a new project
If you're using Soldeer for the first time in a new Foundry project, you can use the `init` command to install a fresh instance of Soldeer, complete with the necessary configurations and the latest version of `forge-std`.
```bash
forge soldeer init
```


### Adding a Dependency

#### Add a Dependency Stored in the Central Repository

To add a dependency, you can visit [soldeer.xyz](https://soldeer.xyz) and search for the dependency you want to add (e.g., openzeppelin 5.0.2).

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/Hm6R8MTs/Unknown-413.png)

Then just run the forge command:
```bash
forge soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.0.2
```

This will download the dependency from the central repository and install it into a `dependencies` directory.

Soldeer can manage two types of dependency configuration: using `soldeer.toml` or embedded in the `foundry.toml`. In order to work with Foundry, you have to define the `[dependencies]` config in the `foundry.toml`. This will tell the `soldeer CLI` to define the installed dependencies there.
E.g.

```toml
# Full reference https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/config

[profile.default]
auto_detect_solc = false 
bytecode_hash = "none" 
fuzz = { runs = 1_000 } 
libs = ["dependencies"] # <= This is important to be added
gas_reports = ["*"] 

[dependencies] # <= Dependencies will be added under this config
"@openzeppelin-contracts" = { version = "5.0.2" }
"@uniswap-universal-router" = { version = "1.6.0" }
"@prb-math" = { version = "4.0.2" }
forge-std = { version = "1.8.1" }
```

#### Add a Dependency Stored at a Specific Link

If the central repository does not have a certain dependency, you can install it by providing a zip archive link.

E.g.
```bash
forge soldeer install @custom-dependency~1.0.0 https://my-website.com/custom-dependency-1-0-0.zip
```

The above command will try to download the dependency from the provided link and install it as a normal dependency. For this, you will see in the config an additional field called `path`.

E.g.
```toml
[dependencies]
"@custom-dependency" = { version = "1.0.0", path = "https://my-website.com/custom-dependency-1-0-0.zip" }
```

#### Add a Dependency Stored in GIT
If you choose to use Git as a source for your dependencies — though we generally discourage this, since Git isn't designed to be a dependency manager — you can provide the Git repository link as an additional argument. Soldeer will then automatically handle the installation using a Git subprocess.
For example:
```bash
forge soldeer install forge-std~1.9.2 https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std.git
```

If you want to use a specific revision, branch, or tag, you can do so by appending the following arguments to the command: `--rev/--tag/--branch`

e.g.
```bash
forge soldeer install forge-std~1.9.2 https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std.git --rev 4695fac44b2934aaa6d7150e2eaf0256fdc566a7
```


### Updating Dependencies

Because Soldeer specifies the dependencies in a config file (foundry or soldeer toml), sharing a dependency configuration within the team is much easier.

For example, having this Foundry config file in a git repository, one can pull the repository and then run `forge soldeer update`. This command will automatically install all the dependencies specified under the `[dependencies]` tag.

```toml
# Full reference https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/config

[profile.default]
auto_detect_solc = false 
bytecode_hash = "none" 
fuzz = { runs = 1_000 } 
libs = ["dependencies"] # <= This is important to be added
gas_reports = ["*"]

[dependencies] # <= Dependencies will be added under this config
"@openzeppelin-contracts" = { version = "5.0.2" }
"@uniswap-universal-router" = { version = "1.6.0" }
"@prb-math" = { version = "4.0.2" }
forge-std = { version = "1.8.1" }
```

### Removing Dependencies

You can use `forge soldeer uninstall DEPENDENCY`.

Example: `forge soldeer uninstall @openzeppelin-contracts`. This will action will remove:
- the config entry
- the `dependencies` artifacts
- the `soldeer.lock` entry
- the `remappings` entry (txt or config remapping)

Additionally you can manually remove a dependency by just removing the artifacts: dependency files, config entry, remappings entry.

### Remappings

The remappings are now fully configurable, the config TOML file (foundry.toml) accepts a
`[soldeer]` field with the following options

```toml
[soldeer]
# whether soldeer manages remappings
remappings_generate = true

# whether soldeer re-generates all remappings when installing, updating or uninstalling deps
remappings_regenerate = false

# whether to suffix the remapping with the version: `name-a.b.c`
remappings_version = true

# a prefix to add to the remappings ("@" would give `@name`)
remappings_prefix = ""

# where to store the remappings ("txt" for `remappings.txt` or "config" for `foundry.toml`)
# ignored when `soldeer.toml` is used as config (uses `remappings.txt`)
remappings_location = "txt"
```

### Installing dependencies of dependencies aka sub-dependencies

Whenever you install a dependency, that dependency might have other dependencies that need to be installed as well. Currently, you can handle this by either specifying the `recursive_deps` field as a configuration entry in the config file or by passing the `--recursive-deps` argument when running the install or update command. This will ensure that all necessary sub-dependencies are automatically pulled in.
e.g.
```toml
[soldeer]
recursive_deps = true
```


### Pushing a New Version to the Central Repository

Soldeer acts like npmjs/crates.io, encouraging all developers to publish their projects to the central repository.

To do that, you have to go to [soldeer.xyz](https://soldeer.xyz), create an account, verify it, then

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/G3VDpN2S/s1.png) 

Just add a new project

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/rsBRYd3L/s2.png) 

After the project is created, you can go into your project source and:
- Create a `.soldeerignore` file that acts as a `.gitignore` to exclude files that aren't needed. The `.gitignore` file is also respected. 
- Run `forge soldeer login` to log into your account. 
- Run `forge soldeer push my-project~1.0.0` in your terminal in the directory that you want to push to the central repository associated with the project `my-project` at version `1.0.0`. 

If you want to push a specific directory and not the current directory your terminal is in, you can use `forge soldeer push my-project~1.0.0 /path/to/directory`.


**Warning** ⚠️

You are at risk to push sensitive files to the central repository that then can be seen by everyone. Make sure to exclude sensitive files in the `.soldeerignore` file.
Furthermore, we've implemented a warning that it will be triggered if you try to push a project that contains any `.dot` files/directories.
If you want to skip this warning, you can just use
```bash
forge soldeer push my-project~1.0.0 --skip-warnings
```



#### Dry-run
In case you want to simulate what would happen if you push a version, you can use the `--dry-run` flag. This will create a zip file that you can inspect before pushing it to the central repository. 

```bash
forge soldeer push my-project~1.0.0 --dry-run
```

#### Login Data
By default, Soldeer saves the login token in the `~/.soldeer/.soldeer_login` file, which is used to push files to the central repository. If you prefer to save the token in a different location, you can set the environment variable `SOLDEER_LOGIN_FILE`.


> **Warning** ⚠️
> - Once a project is created, it cannot be deleted.
> - Once a version is pushed, it cannot be deleted.
> - You cannot push the same version twice.
> - The project name in the command that you run in the terminal must match the project name that you created on the Soldeer website.
> - We encourage everyone to use version pinning when importing them into the contracts, this will help with securing your code by knowing exactly what version of a dependency you are using. Furthermore, it will help security researchers in their work.
> - Make sure you delete this zip file before pushing the version if you run dry-run.
e.g. instead of using
`import '@openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC20.sol'` you should do
`import '@openzeppelin-contracts-5.0.2/token/ERC20.sol'`

### What happens if a certain package is not present in the central repository?
- If a certain package is not present in the central repository, you can open an issue in the [Soldeer Repository](https://github.com/mario-eth/soldeer/issues) and the team will look into adding it.
- If you have a package that you want to use and it is not present in the central repository, you can push it to the central repository by following the steps above.
