## anvil

### NAME

anvil - Create a local testnet node for deploying and testing smart contracts. It can also be used to fork other EVM compatible networks.

### SYNOPSIS

`anvil` [*options*]

### DESCRIPTION

Create a local testnet node for deploying and testing smart contracts. It can also be used to fork other EVM compatible networks.

This section covers an extensive list of information about Mining Modes, Supported Transport Layers, Supported RPC Methods, Anvil flags and their usages. You can run multiple flags at the same time.

#### Mining Modes
Mining modes refer to how frequent blocks are mined using Anvil. By default, it automatically generates a new block as soon as a transaction is submitted.

You can change this setting to interval mining if you will, which means that a new block will be generated in a given period of time selected by the user. If you want to go for this type of mining, you can do it by adding the `--block-time <block-time-in-seconds>` flag, like in the following example.
```sh
# Produces a new block every 10 seconds
anvil --block-time 10
```

There's also a third mining mode called never. In this case, it disables auto and interval mining, and mine on demand instead. You can do this by typing:
```sh
# Enables never mining mode
anvil --no-mining
```

To speed up the finalization of blocks, you can use the `--slots-in-an-epoch` flag with a value of `1` for example. This will lead to the block at height `N-2` being finalized, where `N` is the latest block.

#### Supported Transport Layers
HTTP and Websocket connections are supported. The server listens on port 8545 by default, but it can be changed by running the following command:

```sh
anvil --port <PORT>
```

#### Default CREATE2 Deployer
Anvil, when used without forking, includes the [default CREATE2 deployer proxy](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy) at the address `0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c`.

This allows you to test CREATE2 deployments locally without forking.

##### Custom Methods
The `anvil_*` namespace is an alias for `hardhat`. For more info, refer to the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference#hardhat-network-methods).

`anvil_impersonateAccount`

`anvil_stopImpersonatingAccount`
Stops impersonating an account or contract if previously set with `anvil_impersonateAccount`.

`anvil_autoImpersonateAccount`
Accepts `true` to enable auto impersonation of accounts, and `false` to disable it. When enabled, any transaction's sender will be automatically impersonated. Same as `anvil_impersonateAccount`.

`anvil_getAutomine`
Returns true if automatic mining is enabled, and false if it is not.

`anvil_mine`
Mines a series of blocks.

`anvil_dropTransaction`
Removes transactions from the pool.

`anvil_reset`
Reset the fork to a fresh forked state, and optionally update the fork config.

`anvil_setRpcUrl`
Sets the backend RPC URL.

`anvil_setBalance`
Modifies the balance of an account.

`anvil_setCode`
Sets the code of a contract.

`anvil_setNonce`
Sets the nonce of an address.

`anvil_setStorageAt`
Writes a single slot of the account's storage.

`anvil_setCoinbase`
Sets the coinbase address.

`anvil_setLoggingEnabled`
Enable or disable logging.

`anvil_setMinGasPrice`
Set the minimum gas price for the node.

`anvil_setNextBlockBaseFeePerGas`
Sets the base fee of the next block.

`anvil_setChainId`
Sets the chain ID of the current EVM instance.

`anvil_dumpState`
Returns a hex string representing the complete state of the chain. Can be re-imported into a fresh/restarted instance of Anvil to reattain the same state.

`anvil_loadState`
When given a hex string previously returned by `anvil_dumpState`, merges the contents into the current chain state. Will overwrite any colliding accounts/storage slots.

`anvil_nodeInfo`
Retrieves the configuration params for the currently running Anvil node.

##### Special Methods
The special methods come from Ganache. You can take a look at the documentation [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli-archive/blob/master/README.md).

`evm_setAutomine`
Enables or disables, based on the single boolean argument, the automatic mining of new blocks with each new transaction submitted to the network.

`evm_setIntervalMining`
Sets the mining behavior to interval with the given interval (seconds).

`evm_snapshot`
Snapshot the state of the blockchain at the current block.

`evm_revert`
Revert the state of the blockchain to a previous snapshot. Takes a single parameter, which is the snapshot id to revert to.

`evm_increaseTime`
Jump forward in time by the given amount of time, in seconds.

`evm_setNextBlockTimestamp`
Similar to `evm_increaseTime` but takes the exact timestamp that you want in the next block.

`anvil_setBlockTimestampInterval`
Similar to `evm_increaseTime` but sets a block timestamp `interval`. The timestamp of the next block will be computed as `lastBlock_timestamp + interval`.

`evm_setBlockGasLimit`
Sets the block gas limit for the following blocks.

`anvil_removeBlockTimestampInterval`
Removes an `anvil_setBlockTimestampInterval` if it exists.

`evm_mine`

1. Generate shell completions script for zsh:
    ```sh
    anvil completions zsh > $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_anvil
    ```


### Usage within Docker

In order to run anvil as a service in Github Actions with the [Docker container](../../tutorials/foundry-docker.md), where passing arguments to the entrypoint command is not possible, use the `ANVIL_IP_ADDR` environment variable to set the host's IP. `ANVIL_IP_ADDR=0.0.0.0` is equivalent to providing the `--host <ip>` option.

#### Using `genesis.json` 

The `genesis.json` file in Anvil serves a similar purpose as in Geth, defining the network's initial state, consensus rules, and preallocated accounts to ensure all nodes start consistently and maintain network integrity. All values, including balance, gas limit and such, are to be defined as hexadecimals.

- `chainId`: Identifier for the blockchain, unique to each network.
- `nonce`: A counter used in hashing algorithms to ensure data integrity.
- `timestamp`: The creation time of the genesis block in Unix time.
- `extraData`: Additional data that can be included by the creator of the genesis block.
- `gasLimit`: The maximum amount of gas that can be used in the block.
- `difficulty`: A measure of how difficult it is to mine a new block.
- `mixHash`: A unique identifier proving a sufficient amount of computation for the block.
- `coinbase`: The Ethereum address of the miner who mined this block.
- `stateRoot`: The root of the state trie, reflecting the final state after all transactions.
- `alloc`: Allows pre-allocating Ether to a set of addresses with predefined balances.
- `number`: The block number, with the genesis block being 0.
- `gasUsed`: The total gas used in the block.
- `parentHash`: The hash of the parent block, all zeros for the genesis block since there is no parent.

A sample for simulating mainnet via genesis can be found [here](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/8f3e4a15738d8174d41f4aede5570ecead141a77/crates/primitives/res/genesis/mainnet.json).
