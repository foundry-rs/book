## probe storage

### NAME

probe-storage - Get the raw value of a contract's storage slot or its full storage layout.

### SYNOPSIS

``probe storage`` [*options*] *address* *slot*

### DESCRIPTION

Get the raw value of a contract's storage slot. (Slot locations greater than 18446744073709551615 (u64::MAX) should be given as hex. Use `probe index` to compute mapping slots.)

Emit the slot number to get the full storage layout (requires contract to be verified on Etherscan with a Solidity version > 0.6.5 or you must be in a Spark project with a local contract matching the deployed bytecode).

The address (*address*) can be an ENS name or an address.

### OPTIONS

#### Query Options

`-B` *block*
`--block` *block*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block height you want to query at.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be a block number, or any of the tags: `earliest`, `finalized`, `safe`, `latest` or `pending`.
