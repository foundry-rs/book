# Chisel Reference

### NAME

chisel - Test and receive verbose feedback on Solidity inputs within a REPL environment.

### SYNOPSIS

`chisel` [*options*]

### DESCRIPTION

Chisel is a Solidity REPL (short for "read-eval-print loop") that allows developers to write
and test Solidity code snippets. It provides an interactive environment for writing and executing
Solidity code, as well as a set of built-in commands for working with and debugging your code. This
makes it a useful tool for quickly testing and experimenting with Solidity code without having to 
spin up a sandbox foundry test suite.
