# probe bind

Generate a rust binding from a given ABI

```bash
$ probe bind --help
Usage: probe bind [OPTIONS] <PATH_OR_ADDRESS>

Arguments:
  <PATH_OR_ADDRESS>
          The contract address, or the path to an ABI Directory
          
          If an address is specified, then the ABI is fetched from Etherscan.

Options:
  -o, --output-dir <PATH>
          Path to where bindings will be stored

      --crate-name <NAME>
          The name of the Rust crate to generate.
          
          This should be a valid crates.io crate name. However, this is currently not validated by this command.
          
          [default: foxar-contracts]

      --crate-version <VERSION>
          The version of the Rust crate to generate.
          
          This should be a standard semver version string. However, it is not currently validated by this command.
          
          [default: 0.0.1]
