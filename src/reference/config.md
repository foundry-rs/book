## Config Reference

Foundry's configuration system allows you to configure its tools.

### Profiles

Configuration can be arbitrarily namespaced into profiles. The default profile is named `default`, and all other profiles inherit values from this profile.

You can select the profile to use by setting the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.

### Global configuration

You can create a `foundry.toml` file in your home folder to configure Foundry globally.

### Environment variables

Configuration can be overriden with `FOUNDRY_` and `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables.

### Configuration format

Configuration files are written in the [TOML format](https://toml.io), with simple key-value pairs inside of sections. The following gives a quick overview of all settings (and their default values), with detailed descriptions found below.

### Configuration keys

This section documents all configuration keys. All configuration keys must live under a profile, such as `default`.

#### Project

Configuration related to the project in general.

##### `src`

- Type: string
- Default: src
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_SRC` or `DAPP_SRC`

The path to the contract sources relative to the root of the project.

##### `test`

- Type: string
- Default: test
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_TEST` or `DAPP_TEST`

The path to the test contract sources relative to the root of the project.

##### `out`

- Type: string
- Default: out
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_OUT` or `DAPP_OUT`

The path to put contract artifacts in, relative to the root of the project.

##### `libs`

- Type: array of strings (paths)
- Default: lib
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_LIBS` or `DAPP_LIBS`

An array of paths that contain libraries, relative to the root of the project.

##### `cache`

- Type: boolean
- Default: true
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_CACHE` or `DAPP_CACHE`

Whether or not to enable caching. If enabled, the result of compiling sources, tests, and dependencies, are cached in `cache`.

##### `force`

- Type: boolean
- Default: false
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_FORCE` or `DAPP_FORCE`

Whether or not to perform a clean build, discarding the cache.

#### Solidity compiler

Configuration related to the behavior of the Solidity compiler.

##### `remappings`

- Type: array of strings (remappings)
- Default: none
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_REMAPPINGS` or `DAPP_REMAPPINGS`

An array of remappings in the following format: `<name>=<target>`.

A remapping _remaps_ Solidity imports to different directories. For example, the following remapping

```ignore
@openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

with an import like

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
```

becomes

```solidity
import "node_modules/@openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
```

##### `libraries`

- Type: array of strings (libraries)
- Default: none
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_LIBRARIES` or `DAPP_LIBRARIES`

An array of libraries to link against in the following format: `<file>:<lib>:<address>`, for example: `src/MyLibrary.sol:MyLibrary:0xfD88CeE74f7D78697775aBDAE53f9Da1559728E4`.


##### `solc_version`

- Type: string (semver)
- Default: none
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_SOLC_VERSION` or `DAPP_SOLC_VERSION`

If specified, overrides the auto-detection system (more below) and uses a single Solidity compiler version for the project.

Only strict versions are supported (i.e. `0.8.11` is valid, but `^0.8.0` is not).

##### `auto_detect_solc`

- Type: boolean
- Default: true
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_AUTO_DETECT_SOLC` or `DAPP_AUTO_DETECT_SOLC`

If enabled, Foundry will automatically try to resolve appropriate Solidity compiler versions to compile your project.

This key is ignored if `solc_version` is set.

##### `offline`

- Type: boolean
- Default: false
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_OFFLINE` or `DAPP_OFFLINE`

If enabled, Foundry will not attempt to download any missing solc versions.

If both `offline` and `auto-detect-solc` are set to `true`, the required version(s) of solc will be auto detected but any missing versions will *not* be installed.

##### `optimizer`

- Type: boolean
- Default: true

Whether or not to enable the Solidity compiler optimizer.

##### `evm_version`

- Type: string
- Default: london
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_EVM_VERSION` or `DAPP_EVM_VERSION`

The EVM version to use during tests. The value **must** be an EVM hardfork name, such as `london`, `byzantium`, etc.

##### `verbosity`

- Type: integer
- Default: 0
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_VERBOSITY` or `DAPP_VERBOSITY`

The verbosity level to use during tests.

- **Level 2 (`-vv`)**: Logs emitted during tests are also displayed.
- **Level 3 (`-vvv`)**: Stack traces for failing tests are also displayed.
- **Level 4 (`-vvvv`)**: Stack traces for all tests are displayed, and setup traces for failing tests are displayed.
- **Level 5 (`-vvvvv`)**: Stack traces and setup traces are always displayed.

##### `fuzz_runs`

- Type: integer
- Default: 256
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_FUZZ_RUNS` or `DAPP_FUZZ_RUNS`

- Default: 65536
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_FUZZ_MAX_GLOBAL_REJECTS`

##### `ffi`

- Type: boolean
- Default: false
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_FFI` or `DAPP_FFI`

Whether or not to enable the `ffi` cheatcode.

**Warning:** Enabling this cheatcode has security implications for your project, as it allows tests to execute arbitrary programs on your computer.
