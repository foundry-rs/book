#### Watch Options

`-w` [*path...*]  
`--watch` [*path...*]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch specific file(s) or folder(s).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, the project's source directory is watched.

`-d` *delay*  
`--delay` *delay*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File update debounce delay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the delay, incoming change events are accumulated and only once the delay has passed, is an action taken.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that this does not mean a command will be started: if `--no-restart` is given and a command is already running, the outcome of the action will be to do nothing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defaults to 50ms. Parses as decimal seconds by default, but using an integer with the `ms` suffix may be more convenient.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using `--poll` mode, you'll want a larger duration, or risk overloading disk I/O.

`--no-restart`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not restart the command while it's running.

`--run-all`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explicitly re-run the command on all files when a change is made.
