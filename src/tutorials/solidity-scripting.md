## Solidity Scripting

### Introduction

Solidity scripting is a way to declaratively deploy contracts using Solidity, instead of using the more limiting and less user friendly [`forge create`](../reference/forge/forge-create.md).

Solidity scripts are like the scripts you write when working with tools like Hardhat; what makes Solidity scripting different is that they are written in Solidity instead of JavaScript, and they are run on the fast Foundry backend, which provides dry-run capabilities.

### High Level Overview

`forge script` does not work in a sync manner. First, it collects all transactions from the script, and only then does it broadcast them all. It can essentially be split into 4 phases:

1. Local Simulation - The contract script is run in a local evm. If a rpc/fork url has been provided, it will execute the script in that context. Any **external call** (not static, not internal) from a `vm.broadcast` and/or `vm.startBroadcast` will be appended to a list.
2. Onchain Simulation - Optional. If a rpc/fork url has been provided, then it will sequentially execute all the collected transactions from the previous phase here.
3. Broadcasting - Optional. If the `--broadcast` flag is provided and the previous phases have succeeded, it will broadcast the transactions collected at step `1`. and simulated at step `2`.

Given this flow, it's important to be aware that transactions whose behaviour can be influenced by external state/actors might have a different result than what was simulated on step `2`. Eg. frontrunning.

### Set Up

Letâ€™s try to deploy the NFT contract made in the solmate tutorial with solidity scripting. First of all, we would need to create a new Foundry project via:

```sh
forge init solidity-scripting
```

Since the NFT contract from the solmate tutorial inherits both `solmate` and `OpenZeppelin` contracts, weâ€™ll have to install them as dependencies by running:

```sh
# Enter the project
cd solidity-scripting

# Install Solmate and OpenZeppelin contracts as dependencies
forge install transmissions11/solmate Openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.0.1
```

Next, we have to delete the `Counter.sol` file in the `src` folder and create another file called `NFT.sol`. You can do this by running:

```sh
rm src/Counter.sol script/Counter.s.sol test/Counter.t.sol && touch src/NFT.sol && ls src
```

Once thatâ€™s done, you should open up your preferred code editor and copy the code below into the `NFT.sol` file.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.8.10;

import {ERC721} from "solmate/tokens/ERC721.sol";
import {Ownable} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import {Strings} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";

error MintPriceNotPaid();
error MaxSupply();
error NonExistentTokenURI();
error WithdrawTransfer();

contract NFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    using Strings for uint256;

    string public baseURI;
    uint256 public currentTokenId;
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_SUPPLY = 10_000;
    uint256 public constant MINT_PRICE = 0.08 ether;

    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        string memory _baseURI
    ) ERC721(_name, _symbol) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        baseURI = _baseURI;
    }

    function mintTo(address recipient) public payable returns (uint256) {
        if (msg.value != MINT_PRICE) {
            revert MintPriceNotPaid();
        }
        uint256 newTokenId = ++currentTokenId;
        if (newTokenId > TOTAL_SUPPLY) {
            revert MaxSupply();
        }
        _safeMint(recipient, newTokenId);
        return newTokenId;
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (string memory)
    {
        if (ownerOf(tokenId) == address(0)) {
            revert NonExistentTokenURI();
        }
        return
            bytes(baseURI).length > 0
                ? string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, tokenId.toString()))
                : "";
    }

    function withdrawPayments(address payable payee) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        (bool transferTx, ) = payee.call{value: balance}("");
        if (!transferTx) {
            revert WithdrawTransfer();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, letâ€™s try compiling our contract to make sure everything is in order.

```sh
forge build --zksync
```

If your output looks like this, the contracts successfully compiled.
![compile successful](../images/solidity-scripting/compile-successful.png)

### Deploying our contract

Weâ€™re going to deploy the `NFT` contract to the ZKsync Sepolia testnet, but to do this weâ€™ll need to configure Foundry ZKsync a bit, by setting things like a ZKsync Sepolia RPC URL, and the private key of an account thatâ€™s funded with ZKsync Sepolia Eth.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: You can get some ZKsync Sepolia testnet ETH [here](https://thirdweb.com/zksync-sepolia-testnet) .

#### Environment Configuration

Once you have all that create a `.env` file and add the variables. Foundry automatically loads in a `.env` file present in your project directory.

The .env file should follow this format:

```sh
ZKSYNC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
PRIVATE_KEY=
```

We now need to edit the `foundry.toml` file. There should already be one in the root of the project.

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```toml
[rpc_endpoints]
zksync-sepolia = "${ZKSYNC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL}"
```

This creates a [RPC alias](../cheatcodes/rpc.md) for ZKsync Sepolia.

#### Writing the Script

Next, we have to create a folder and name it `script` and create a file in it called `NFT.s.sol`. This is where we will create the deployment script itself.

The contents of `NFT.s.sol` should look like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {NFT} from "../src/NFT.sol";

contract MyScript is Script {
    function run() external {
        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);

        NFT nft = new NFT("NFT_tutorial", "TUT", "baseUri");

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

Now letâ€™s read through the code and figure out what it actually means and does.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
```

Remember even if itâ€™s a script it still works like a smart contract, but is never deployed, so just like any other smart contract written in Solidity the `pragma version` has to be specified.

```solidity
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {NFT} from "../src/NFT.sol";
```

Just like we may import Forge Std to get testing utilities when writing tests, Forge Std also provides some scripting utilities that we import here.

The next line just imports the `NFT` contract.

```solidity
contract MyScript is Script {
```

We have created a contract called `MyScript` and it inherits `Script` from Forge Std.

```solidity
function run() external {
```

By default, scripts are executed by calling the function named `run`, our entrypoint.

```solidity
uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
```

This loads in the private key from our `.env` file. **Note:** you must be careful when exposing private keys in a `.env` file and loading them into programs. This is only recommended for use with non-privileged deployers or for local / test setups. For production setups please review the various [wallet options](../reference/forge/forge-script.md#wallet-options---raw) that Foundry supports.

```solidity
vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);
```

This is a special cheatcode that records calls and contract creations made by our main script contract. We pass the `deployerPrivateKey` in order to instruct it to use that key for signing the transactions. Later, we will broadcast these transactions to deploy our NFT contract.

```solidity
NFT nft = new NFT("NFT_tutorial", "TUT", "baseUri");
```

Here we have just created our NFT contract. Because we called `vm.startBroadcast()` before this line, the contract creation will be recorded by Forge, and as mentioned previously, we can broadcast the transaction to deploy the contract on-chain. The broadcast transaction logs will be stored in the `broadcast` directory by default. You can change the logs location by setting [`broadcast`](../reference/config/project.md#broadcast) in your `foundry.toml` file.

Now that youâ€™re up to speed about what the script smart contract does, letâ€™s run it.

You should have added the variables we mentioned earlier to the `.env` for this next part to work.

At the root of the project run:

```sh
# To load the variables in the .env file
source .env

# To deploy our contract
forge script --chain zksync-testnet script/NFT.s.sol:MyScript --rpc-url $ZKSYNC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --zksync -vvvv
```

Forge is going to run our script and broadcast the transactions for us - this can take a little while, since Forge will also wait for the transaction receipts.

This confirms that you have successfully deployed the `NFT` contract to the ZKsync Sepolia testnet.
