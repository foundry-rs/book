## cast bind

Generate a rust binding from a given ABI

```bash
$ cast bind --help
```

```txt
Usage: cast bind [OPTIONS] <PATH_OR_ADDRESS>

Arguments:
  <PATH_OR_ADDRESS>
          The contract address, or the path to an ABI Directory
          
          If an address is specified, then the ABI is fetched from Etherscan.

Options:
  -o, --output-dir <PATH>
          Path to where bindings will be stored

      --crate-name <NAME>
          The name of the Rust crate to generate.
          
          This should be a valid crates.io crate name. However, this is
          currently not validated by this command.
          
          [default: foundry-contracts]

      --crate-version <VERSION>
          The version of the Rust crate to generate.
          
          This should be a standard semver version string. However, it is not
          currently validated by this command.
          
          [default: 0.0.1]

      --separate-files
          Generate bindings as separate files

  -e, --etherscan-api-key <KEY>
          The Etherscan (or equivalent) API key
          
          [env: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=]

  -c, --chain <CHAIN>
          The chain name or EIP-155 chain ID
          
          [env: CHAIN=]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -j, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to use. Specifying 0 defaults to the number of
          logical cores
          
          [aliases: --jobs]

Display options:
      --color <COLOR>
          The color of the log messages

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Intelligently guess whether to use color output (default)
          - always: Force color output
          - never:  Force disable color output

      --json
          Format log messages as JSON

      --md
          Format log messages as Markdown

  -q, --quiet
          Do not print log messages

  -v, --verbosity...
          Verbosity level of the log messages.
          
          Pass multiple times to increase the verbosity (e.g. -v, -vv, -vvv).
          
          Depending on the context the verbosity levels have different meanings.
          
          For example, the verbosity levels of the EVM are:
          - 2 (-vv): Print logs for all tests.
          - 3 (-vvv): Print execution traces for failing tests.
          - 4 (-vvvv): Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces
          for failing tests.
          - 5 (-vvvvv): Print execution and setup traces for all tests,
          including storage changes and
            backtraces with line numbers.
