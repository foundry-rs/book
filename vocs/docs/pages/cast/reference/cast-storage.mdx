## cast storage

### NAME

cast-storage - Get the raw value of a contract's storage slot or its full storage layout.

### SYNOPSIS

`cast storage` [*options*] _address_ _slot_

### DESCRIPTION

Get the raw value of a contract's storage slot. (Slot locations greater than 18446744073709551615 (u64::MAX) should be given as hex. Use `cast index` to compute mapping slots.)

Omit the slot number to get the full storage layout (requires contract to be verified on Etherscan with a Solidity version > 0.6.5 or you must be in a Forge project with a local contract matching the deployed bytecode).

The address (_address_) can be an ENS name or an address.

### OPTIONS

`-B` _block_
`--block` _block_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block height you want to query at.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be a block number, or any of the tags: `earliest`, `finalized`, `safe`, `latest` or `pending`.
