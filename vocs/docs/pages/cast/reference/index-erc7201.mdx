          - 3 (-vvv): Print execution traces for failing tests.
          - 4 (-vvvv): Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces
          for failing tests.
          - 5 (-vvvvv): Print execution and setup traces for all tests,
          including storage changes and
            backtraces with line numbers.
