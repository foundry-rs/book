## cast to-rlp

RLP encodes hex data, or an array of hex data.

Accepts a hex-encoded string, or an array of hex-encoded strings. Can be
arbitrarily recursive.

Examples: - `cast to-rlp "[]"` -> `0xc0` - `cast to-rlp "0x22"` -> `0x22` -
`cast to-rlp "[\"0x61\"]"` -> `0xc161` - `cast to-rlp "[\"0xf1\", \"f2\"]"` ->
`0xc481f181f2`

```bash
$ cast to-rlp --help

Usage: cast to-rlp [OPTIONS] [VALUE]

Arguments:
  [VALUE]
          The value to convert.
          
          This is a hex-encoded string, or an array of hex-encoded strings. Can
          be arbitrarily recursive.

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -j, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to use. Specifying 0 defaults to the number of
          logical cores
          
          [aliases: --jobs]

Display options:
      --color <COLOR>
          The color of the log messages

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Intelligently guess whether to use color output (default)
          - always: Force color output
          - never:  Force disable color output

      --json
          Format log messages as JSON

      --md
          Format log messages as Markdown

  -q, --quiet
          Do not print log messages

  -v, --verbosity...
          Verbosity level of the log messages.
          
          Pass multiple times to increase the verbosity (e.g. -v, -vv, -vvv).
          
          Depending on the context the verbosity levels have different meanings.
          
          For example, the verbosity levels of the EVM are:
          - 2 (-vv): Print logs for all tests.
          - 3 (-vvv): Print execution traces for failing tests.
          - 4 (-vvvv): Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces
          for failing tests.
          - 5 (-vvvvv): Print execution and setup traces for all tests,
          including storage changes and
            backtraces with line numbers.
