## Project

Configuration related to the project in general.

##### `extends`

- Type: string or object
- Default: none
- Environment: N/A

Configuration for inheriting from a base TOML file. Can be specified in two formats:

**String format:**
```toml
extends = "./base-config.toml"
```

**Object format with strategy:**
```toml
extends = { path = "./base-config.toml", strategy = "replace-arrays" }
```

The path must be relative to the location of the `foundry.toml` file. When specified, configuration from the base file is merged with the current profile's configuration.

**Available strategies:**
- `"extend-arrays"` (default): Arrays are concatenated (base elements + local elements), other values are replaced
- `"replace-arrays"`: Arrays are replaced entirely (local arrays replace base arrays)
- `"no-collision"`: Throws an error if any keys exist in both the base and local files

##### `src`

- Type: string
- Default: src
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_SRC` or `DAPP_SRC`

The path to the contract sources relative to the root of the project.

##### `test`

- Type: string
- Default: test
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_TEST` or `DAPP_TEST`

The path to the test contract sources relative to the root of the project.

##### `script`

- Type: string
- Default: script
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_SCRIPT` or `DAPP_SCRIPT`

The path to the script contract sources relative to the root of the project.

##### `out`

- Type: string
- Default: out
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_OUT` or `DAPP_OUT`

The path to put contract artifacts in, relative to the root of the project.

##### `libs`

- Type: array of strings (paths)
- Default: lib
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_LIBS` or `DAPP_LIBS`

An array of paths that contain libraries, relative to the root of the project.

##### `cache`

- Type: boolean
- Default: true
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_CACHE` or `DAPP_CACHE`

Whether or not to enable caching. If enabled, the result of compiling sources, tests, and dependencies, are cached in `cache`.

##### `cache_path`

- Type: string
- Default: cache
- Environment: `FOUNDRY_CACHE_PATH` or `DAPP_CACHE_PATH`

The path to the cache, relative to the root of the project.

##### `broadcast`
