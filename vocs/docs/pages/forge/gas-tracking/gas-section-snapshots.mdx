# Gas Section Snapshots

Forge can capture gas snapshots over arbitrary sections inside of your test functions. This can be useful to get a granular measurement of how much gas your logic is consuming as both external calls and internal gas usage are measured.

Instead of running a command like `forge snapshot` or `forge test --gas-report`, you use the `snapshotGas` [cheatcodes](/reference/cheatcodes/gas-snapshots) in your tests to capture gas usage as follows:

<GasSnapshots />
