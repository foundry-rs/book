## forge coverage

### NAME

forge-coverage - Displays which parts of your code are covered by tests.

### SYNOPSIS

`forge coverage` [*options*]

### DESCRIPTION

Displays which parts of your code are covered by tests.

> **Warning** ⚠️
>
> The `derive function end line` feature introduced in `lcov` 2.0 version (and enabled by default) is not supported, therefore `lcov` and `genhtml` should be run with `--rc derive_function_end_line=0` option in order to generate coverage report.

### Options

#### Report Options

`--report` allows you to specify the report type to use for coverage. This flag can be used multiple times.

It has three different options and is set to `summary` by default.

`summary`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs a chart showing what percentage of your code is covered by tests.

`lcov`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a lcov.info file containing your coverage data in the root of your project's directory.

`debug`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs lines describing the location of uncovered code.

<CommonOptions />

#### Optimization Option

`--ir-minimum` allows you to run the coverage with `via-ir` enabled for the ["minimum amount of optimization"](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12533#issuecomment-1013073350) necessary.

#### Contract Exclusion

`--no-match-coverage "(script|Foo|Bar)"` allows you to exclude paths and contracts from the coverage report.

### EXAMPLES

1. View summarized coverage:

   ```sh
   forge coverage
   ```

2. Create lcov file with coverage data:

   ```sh
   forge coverage --report lcov
   ```

3. Output uncovered code locations:

   ```sh
   forge coverage --report debug
   ```

4. Coverage report without including `script` directory:
   ```sh
   forge coverage --no-match-coverage script
   ```
