description: Documentation standards using NatSpec comments for autogenerated docs and improved code readability.

## Commenting

1. For public or external methods and variables, use [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) comments.

- `forge doc` will parse these to autogenerate documentation.
- Etherscan will display them in the contract UI.

2. For simple NatSpec comments, consider just documenting params in the docstring, such as `` /// @notice Returns the sum of `x` and `y`. ``, instead of using `@param` tags.

3. For complex NatSpec comments, consider using a tool like [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/ascii-art) to generate ASCII art diagrams to help explain complex aspects of the codebase.

4. Any markdown in your comments will carry over properly when generating docs with `forge doc`, so structure comments with markdown when useful.

   - Good: `` /// @notice Returns the sum of `x` and `y`. ``
   - Bad: `/// @notice Returns the sum of x and y.`
