# Foundry Benchmarks

This page shows the latest performance benchmarks for Foundry across different repositories. The benchmarks are automatically updated from the [Foundry repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/benches/LATEST.md).

## Performance Overview

The table below shows benchmark results comparing different versions of Foundry. Each cell displays the baseline time / latest release time, followed by the percentage change.

## Benchmark Types

### Forge Test

Command: [`forge test`](/forge/tests/overview)

Measures the standard test execution time. Runs all the tests in the repository.

### Forge Fuzz Test

Command: [`forge test --match-test "test[^(]*\([^)]+\)"`](/forge/advanced-testing/fuzz-testing)

Measure the execution time for fuzz tests.

### Forge Test Isolated

Command: [`forge test --isolate`](/forge/reference/test)

Measures the execution time of tests in `isolate` mode.

In isolation mode all top-level calls are executed as a separate transaction in a separate EVM context, enabling more precise gas accounting and transaction state changes.

### Forge Build (No Cache)

Command: [`forge build`](/forge/reference/build)

Measures compilation time on a clean repository i.e no cache available.

### Forge Build (With Cache)

Command: [`forge build`](/forge/reference/build)

Measures execution time for `forge build` in presense of full cache. In this case, compilation is skipped and `forge` only check whether the cache is clean or marked as dirty.

### Forge Coverage

Command: [`forge coverage --ir-minimum`](/forge/reference/coverage)

Measures the time taken to analyze and collect test coverage reports.

It is important to note that this time includes compilation time as well. Before analyzing for coverage every project is recompiled with configuration that will result in accurate coverage reports.
