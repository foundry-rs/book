## Getting Started

This section introduces the `forge` command-line tool. We will walk through creating a new project, compiling it, and running tests.

### Start a new project

To start a new project with Foundry, use the [`forge init`](/forge/reference/forge-init) command:

```sh
// [!include ~/snippets/output/hello_foundry/forge-init:command]
```

Now, letâ€™s explore the structure that `forge` has generated for us:

```sh
cd hello_foundry
```

```sh
// [!include ~/snippets/output/hello_foundry/tree:all]

```

### Build the project

You can compile the project using [`forge build`](/forge/reference/forge-build):

```sh
// [!include ~/snippets/output/hello_foundry/forge-build:all]
```

### Run the tests

To run the tests, use the [`forge test`](/forge/reference/forge-test) command:

```sh
// [!include ~/snippets/output/hello_foundry/forge-test:all]
```
