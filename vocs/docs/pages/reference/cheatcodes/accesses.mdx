## `accesses`

### Signature

```solidity
function accesses(
  address
)
external
returns (
  bytes32[] memory reads,
  bytes32[] memory writes
);
```

### Description

Gets all storage slots that have been read (`reads`) or written to (`writes`) on an address.

Note that [`record`](/reference/cheatcodes/record.mdx) must be called first.

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> Every write also counts as an additional read.

### Examples

```solidity
/// contract NumsContract {
///     uint256 public num1 = 100; // slot 0
///     uint256 public num2 = 200; // slot 1
/// }

vm.record();
numsContract.num2();
(bytes32[] memory reads, bytes32[] memory writes) = vm.accesses(
  address(numsContract)
);
emit log_uint(uint256(reads[0])); // 1
```
