## Forge Standard Library Reference

Forge Standard Library (Forge Std for short) is a collection of helpful contracts that make writing tests easier, faster, and more user-friendly.

Using Forge Std is the preferred way of writing tests with Foundry.

What's included:

- `Vm.sol`: Up-to-date [cheatcodes interface](/reference/cheatcodes/overview#cheatcodes-interface)

  ```solidity
  import {Vm} from "forge-std/Vm.sol";
  ```

- [`console.sol`](/reference/forge-std/console-log.mdx) and `console2.sol`: Hardhat-style logging functionality

  ```solidity
  import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";
  ```

  **Note:** `console2.sol` contains patches to `console.sol` that allow Forge to decode traces for calls to the console, but it is not compatible with Hardhat.

  ```solidity
  import {console2} from "forge-std/console2.sol";
  ```

- `Script.sol`: Basic utilities for [Solidity scripting](/guides/scripting-with-solidity)

  ```solidity
  import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
  ```

- `Test.sol`: The complete Forge Std experience (more details [below](#forge-stds-test))

  ```solidity
  import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
  ```

### Forge Std's `Test`

The `Test` contract in `Test.sol` provides all the essential functionality you need to get started writing tests.

Simply import `Test.sol` and inherit from `Test` in your test contract:

```solidity
import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract ContractTest is Test { ...
```

What's included:

- Std Libraries

  - [Std Logs](/reference/forge-std/std-logs.mdx): Expand upon the logging events from the DSTest library.
  - [Std Assertions](/reference/forge-std/std-assertions.mdx): Expand upon the assertion functions from the DSTest library.
  - [Std Cheats](/reference/forge-std/std-cheats.mdx): Wrappers around Forge cheatcodes for improved safety and DX.
  - [Std Errors](/reference/forge-std/std-errors.mdx): Wrappers around common internal Solidity errors and reverts.
  - [Std Storage](/reference/forge-std/std-storage.mdx): Utilities for storage manipulation.
  - [Std Math](/reference/forge-std/std-math.mdx): Useful mathematical functions.
  - [Script Utils](/reference/forge-std/script-utils.mdx): Utility functions which can be accessed in tests and scripts.
  - [Console Logging](/reference/forge-std/console-log.mdx): Console logging functions.

- A cheatcodes instance `vm`, from which you invoke Forge cheatcodes (see [Cheatcodes Reference](/reference/cheatcodes/overview))

  ```solidity
  vm.startPrank(alice);
  ```

- All Hardhat `console` functions for logging (see [Console Logging](/reference/forge-std/console-log.mdx))

  ```solidity
  console.log(alice.balance); // or `console2`
  ```

- All Dappsys Test functions for asserting and logging (see [Dappsys Test reference](/reference/ds-test.md))

  ```solidity
  assertEq(dai.balanceOf(alice), 10000e18);
  ```

- Utility functions also included in `Script.sol` (see [Script Utils](/reference/forge-std/script-utils.mdx))

  ```solidity
  // Compute the address a contract will be deployed at for a given deployer address and nonce
  address futureContract = computeCreateAddress(alice, 1);
  ```
