# v1.3.0-rc4 [July 30, 2025]

# Foundry v1.3.0

This release includes support for `forge lint`, time-based campaigns and coverage-guided fuzzing for invariant tests, table tests, fork test improvements for [Reth clients](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), and new EIP-712 features. Foundry v1.3.0 is built on top of the latest [`revm v27`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) Foundry v1.3.0 is built on top of the latest revm v27 and comes with an improved `foundryup` installer.

:warning: It is highly recommended to update to latest version of `foundryup`, which avoids unnecessary downloads and verifies hashes of downloaded binaries upon install. You can update your installation by running: `foundryup --update`.

## Performance Improvements

- This release includes an updated [`revm`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) ([#11079](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11079)) and an optimized inspector stack ([#11077](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11077)), which enhances Forge test performance by up to 21.50% [compared to previous versions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/release-1.3.0/benches/LATEST.md)
#### Forge Test

| Repository           | v1.2.3  | v1.3.0  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| ithacaxyz-account    | 3.69 s  | 3.12 s  |
| solady               | 2.95 s  | 2.32 s  |
| Uniswap-v4-core      | 8.03 s  | 6.76 s  |
| sparkdotfi-spark-psm | 57.02 s | 44.76 s |

#### Forge Fuzz Test

| Repository           | v1.2.3 | v1.3.0 |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| ithacaxyz-account    | 3.58 s | 3.39 s |
| solady               | 3.34 s | 2.54 s |
| Uniswap-v4-core      | 8.03 s | 7.46 s |
| sparkdotfi-spark-psm | 3.70 s | 3.06 s             

- Forked tests using the [Reth client](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) are now faster thanks to the `eth_getAccountInfo` API ([#10496](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10496) [#10838](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10838)), reducing account data fetching from three requests to one. Foundry detects if `eth_getAccountInfo` is available and falls back to the legacy method otherwise.  
  Example: Running `forge test --mt statefulFuzz_curve_test` on [spark-alm-controller](https://github.com/sparkdotfi/spark-alm-controller/pull/107) showed over 5 seconds in test time savings.

| Provider                                      | Response Time |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| reth-ethereum.ithaca.xyz (with `eth_getAccountInfo`)    | 45.21s        |
| reth-ethereum.ithaca.xyz (without `eth_getAccountInfo`) | 50.83s        |
| QuickNode (Paid)                             | 59.66s        |
| Alchemy (Free Tier)                          | 182.12s       |
| Infura (Free Tier)                           | 176.88s       |

## Forge Lint

As of v1.3.0, Forge ships with a built-in linter ([#10405](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10405)) that analyzes Solidity code for style, correctness, and best practices.

- Lint rules are configurable in the `[lint]` section of `foundry.toml` and via inline comment directives.
- Lints can be customized by severity or specific rule identifiers.
- By default, linting runs during `forge build`. To disable it, set `lint_on_build = false`.
- For more details please refer to foundry docs:  
[Supported lints](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/forge-lint/#supported-lints)  
[Linter configuration docs](https://getfoundry.sh/config/reference/linter)  
[How to contribute a lint rule](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/docs/dev/lintrules.md)

## Invariant Test Improvements

### Time-Based Campaigns

Previously, invariant tests were limited by a fixed number of runs (default: `256`, max: `4294967295`).  
Now you can run them for a specific time duration by setting the `timeout` value (in seconds) in the `[invariant]` section of `foundry.toml` ([#10190](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10190)).

The test progress bar shows the number of runs and the end time.
```bash
test/GuidedTest.t.sol:CounterTest
 → invariant_Puzzle5: [4360] Runs, ends at 11:03:28 2025-06-03 UTC
 → invariant_Puzzle3: [8784] Runs, ends at 14:50:08 2025-06-04 UTC
 → invariant_Puzzle6: [77762] Runs, ends at 05:56:48 2025-06-09 UTC
 → invariant_Puzzle2: [8739] Runs, ends at 12:50:08 2025-06-02 UTC
 ```

### Coverage-Guided Fuzzing

Enable this mode by setting a path to `corpus_dir` in your invariant config ([#10190](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10190)).  
The coverage-Guided fuzzing mode targets a `corpus_min_size` by mutating entries a number of times (default: 5), favoring those likely to uncover new paths.

**Supported mutations:**
- `splice`: Combines two sequences
- `interleave`: Weaves two sequences together
- `prefix`: Overwrites the beginning of a sequence
- `suffix`: Overwrites the end of a sequence
- `mutate args`: Randomizes some call arguments

Additional notes:
- Entries that generate new coverage are saved to disk (default: `.gz`; set `corpus_gzip = false` to save as JSON).
- On reruns, the saved corpus is loaded and reused.
- Metadata (as JSON) is persisted for evicted corpus entries. This includes a unique ID, mutation count, and coverage improvements.
- The fuzzing progress bar displays metrics for cumulative edges and features, corpus count and number of favored entries.
```bash
test/forge/invariant/StaticInvariantTest.sol:StaticInvariantTest
 → invariantHealthy: [60/2000] Runs
  - cumulative edges seen: 41
  - cumulative features seen: 6
  - corpus count: 15
  - favored items: 14
```
For more details please refer to [invariant docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing/invariant-testing#coverage-guided-fuzzing).

## Table Tests

Foundry v1.3.0 comes with support for table testing ([#10775](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10775)), which enables the definition of a dataset (the "table") and the execution of a test function for each entry in that dataset. This approach helps ensure that certain combinations of inputs and conditions are tested.  
For more details please refer to [table testing foundry docs](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing/table-testing).

## Improved EIP-712 support

Foundry v1.3.0 comes with additional utilities (commands and new cheatcodes) to make it easy and reliable to work with EIP-712 signatures ([#10510](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/10510)).  
For more details please refer to [EIP-712 foundry guide](https://getfoundry.sh/guides/eip712/).
