description: Query blockchain data with Cast — blocks, transactions, logs, and account state.
---

## Reading chain data

Cast queries any Ethereum-compatible chain via JSON-RPC. Set your RPC endpoint with `--rpc-url` or the `ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth.merkle.io
```

### Blocks

```bash [Get the latest block number]
cast block-number
```

```bash [Get block details]
cast block latest
```

```bash [Get a specific block]
cast block 18000000
```

```bash [Get just the timestamp]
cast block latest --field timestamp
```

```bash [Get the base fee]
cast base-fee
```

### Transactions

```bash [Get transaction details]
cast tx $TX_HASH
```

```bash [Get a transaction receipt]
cast receipt $TX_HASH
```

```bash [Check if a transaction succeeded]
cast receipt $TX_HASH --field status
```

```bash [Get gas used]
cast receipt $TX_HASH --field gasUsed
```

### Account state

```bash [Get ETH balance]
cast balance $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Get balance in ether]
cast balance $ADDRESS --ether
```

```bash [Get nonce]
cast nonce $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Get contract bytecode]
cast code $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Read storage slot]
cast storage $ADDRESS 0
```

### Contract calls

Call view functions without sending a transaction:

```bash [Call a function]
cast call $CONTRACT "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $ADDRESS
```

```bash [Call with named output]
cast call $CONTRACT "name()(string)"
```

```bash [Call at a specific block]
cast call $CONTRACT "totalSupply()(uint256)" --block 18000000
```

### Logs and events

```bash [Get logs for an event signature]
cast logs "Transfer(address indexed,address indexed,uint256)" --from-block 18000000
```

```bash [Filter by address]
cast logs --address $CONTRACT --from-block 18000000 --to-block latest
```

```bash [Decode log topics]
cast logs "Transfer(address,address,uint256)" --address $TOKEN
```

### Chain info

```bash [Get chain ID]
cast chain-id
```

```bash [Get current gas price]
cast gas-price
```

```bash [Estimate gas for a call]
cast estimate $CONTRACT "transfer(address,uint256)" $TO $AMOUNT
```

### ENS resolution

```bash [Resolve ENS name to address]
cast resolve-name vitalik.eth
```

```bash [Reverse lookup address to ENS]
cast lookup-address 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```
