## Chisel

Chisel is an interactive Solidity REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for rapid prototyping and debugging. Write and execute Solidity code instantly without compiling full contracts.

### Key capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interactive execution** | Execute Solidity expressions and statements in real-time |
| **Variable inspection** | Inspect values, types, and raw stack/memory data |
| **Forking** | Fork any chain to interact with live contracts |
| **Session management** | Save, load, and export REPL sessions |
| **Project integration** | Access your project's contracts and dependencies |

### Common workflows

```bash [Start the REPL]
chisel
```

```bash [Fork mainnet]
chisel --fork-url https://ethereum.reth.rs/rpc
```

```bash [Evaluate without entering REPL]
chisel eval "uint256 x = 1 + 2; x"
```

```bash [Load a saved session]
chisel load my-session
```

```bash [List cached sessions]
chisel list
```

### Quick example

```solidity
➜ uint256 x = 10
➜ uint256 y = 20
➜ x + y
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x1e
├ Hex (full word): 0x1e
└ Decimal: 30
```
