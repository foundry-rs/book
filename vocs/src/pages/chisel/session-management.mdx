description: Save, load, and export Chisel REPL sessions.

## Session management

Chisel caches sessions so you can save your work and resume later. Sessions store all your Solidity definitions, variables, and state.

### Saving sessions

Save your current session with `!save`:

```solidity
➜ uint256 counter = 100
➜ function increment() public { counter++; }
➜ !save my-session
Saved session to cache with ID = my-session
```

Without an ID, Chisel generates one automatically.

### Loading sessions

Load a previously saved session with `!load`:

```solidity
➜ !load my-session
Loaded session my-session
```

:::warning
Loading a session overwrites your current work. Chisel optimistically caches the current session before loading, but save explicitly if you want to keep it.
:::

### Listing sessions

View all cached sessions:

```solidity
➜ !list
chisel sessions:
├ my-session
└ debug-erc20
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
chisel list
```

### Viewing session source

See the generated Solidity source for a cached session:

```bash
chisel view my-session
```

### Exporting to a script

Export your session as a Foundry script file:

```solidity
➜ !export
Exported session to script/REPL.s.sol
```

This creates a runnable script with all your definitions, useful for turning prototypes into deployable code.

### Clearing sessions

Clear the current session (start fresh):

```solidity
➜ !clear
```

Clear all cached sessions:

```solidity
➜ !clearcache
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
chisel clear-cache
```
