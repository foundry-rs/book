## Configuration

Foundry uses `foundry.toml` for project configuration. This file controls compiler settings, test behavior, formatting rules, and more.

### Quick start

A minimal configuration:

```toml [foundry.toml]
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
solc_version = "0.8.28"
```

View your resolved configuration:

```bash
forge config
```

### Key capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Profiles** | Switch between configurations for development, CI, and production |
| **Environment variables** | Override settings without modifying files |
| **Global config** | Share settings across all your projects |
