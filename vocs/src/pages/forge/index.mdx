## Forge

Forge compiles, tests, and deploys Solidity smart contracts. It's the core development tool in the Foundry suite.

### Key capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Compilation** | Compile contracts with configurable Solidity versions and optimization |
| **Testing** | Write tests in Solidity with fuzzing, forking, and gas reporting |
| **Scripting** | Deploy and interact with contracts using Solidity scripts |
| **Verification** | Verify source code on Etherscan and other explorers |
| **Analysis** | Inspect bytecode, storage layouts, and gas usage |

### Common workflows

```bash [Build your project]
forge build
```

```bash [Run all tests]
forge test
```

```bash [Run tests with verbose output]
forge test -vvvv
```

```bash [Deploy via script]
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

```bash [Verify a deployed contract]
forge verify-contract $ADDRESS src/Counter.sol:Counter --etherscan-api-key $KEY
```
