## Soldeer

[Soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz) is a Solidity-native package manager that provides an alternative to git submodules. It offers versioned dependencies, a package registry, and simpler dependency management.

### Installation

Soldeer comes bundled with Foundry. Initialize it in your project:

```bash
forge soldeer init
```

This creates a `soldeer.toml` configuration file.

### Installing packages

```bash [Install from registry]
forge soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.0.0
```

```bash [Install from git]
forge soldeer install my-lib~1.0.0 https://github.com/org/repo.git
```

Packages are stored in `dependencies/` by default.

### Configuration

Configure Soldeer in `soldeer.toml`:

```toml
[soldeer]
remappings_generate = true
remappings_regenerate = false
remappings_version = true
remappings_prefix = "@"
remappings_location = "config"

[dependencies]
"@openzeppelin-contracts" = "5.0.0"
"@solmate" = "6.7.0"
```

Key options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `remappings_generate` | Auto-generate remappings |
| `remappings_prefix` | Prefix for remappings (e.g., `@`) |
| `remappings_location` | Where to store remappings (`config` or `txt`) |

### Using packages

Import installed packages:

```solidity
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```

When `remappings_location = "config"`, remappings are added to `foundry.toml`. Otherwise, they go to `remappings.txt`.

### Updating packages

```bash [Update all packages]
forge soldeer update
```

```bash [Update a specific package]
forge soldeer update @openzeppelin-contracts
```

### Publishing packages

Publish your own packages to the Soldeer registry:

::::steps

### Login to Soldeer

```bash
forge soldeer login
```

### Prepare your package

Add metadata to `soldeer.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-library"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "My awesome Solidity library"
```

### Publish

```bash
forge soldeer push my-library~1.0.0
```

### Git submodules vs Soldeer

| Feature | Git submodules | Soldeer |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Version pinning | Commit hash | Semantic versions |
| Registry | GitHub | Soldeer registry + git |
| Lock file | No | Yes (`soldeer.lock`) |
| Transitive deps | Manual | Automatic |
| IDE support | Via remappings | Via remappings |

Use git submodules when:
- You need a specific commit
- The library isn't on the Soldeer registry
- Your team is familiar with git submodules

Use Soldeer when:
- You want semantic versioning
- You need reproducible builds (lock file)
- You prefer npm-style dependency management

### Migrating from git submodules

Convert existing submodule dependencies to Soldeer:

```bash
# Remove the submodule
forge remove openzeppelin-contracts

# Install via Soldeer
forge soldeer install @openzeppelin-contracts~5.0.0
```

Update your imports to use the new remapping prefix:

```solidity
// Before
import {ERC20} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// After
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```
