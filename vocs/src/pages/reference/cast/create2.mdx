      --init-code-hash <HASH>
          Init code hash of the contract to be deployed

  -j, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to use. Specifying 0 defaults to the number of

  -h, --help

      --color <COLOR>
          The color of the log messages

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Intelligently guess whether to use color output (default)

  -v, --verbosity...
          Verbosity level of the log messages.
          
          Pass multiple times to increase the verbosity (e.g. -v, -vv, -vvv).
          
          Depending on the context the verbosity levels have different meanings.
          
          For example, the verbosity levels of the EVM are:
          - 2 (-vv): Print logs for all tests.
          - 3 (-vvv): Print execution traces for failing tests.
          - 4 (-vvvv): Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces
          for failing tests.
          - 5 (-vvvvv): Print execution and setup traces for all tests,
          including storage changes and
            backtraces with line numbers.
