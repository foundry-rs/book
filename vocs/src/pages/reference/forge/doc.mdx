Generate documentation for the project

```bash

```

```txt
Usage: forge doc [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --root <PATH>
          The project's root path.
          
          By default root of the Git repository, if in one, or the current
          working directory.

  -o, --out <PATH>
          The doc's output path.
          
          By default, it is the `docs/` in project root.

  -b, --build
          Build the `mdbook` from generated files

  -s, --serve
          Serve the documentation

      --open
          Open the documentation in a browser after serving

      --hostname <HOSTNAME>
          Hostname for serving documentation

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -j, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to use. Specifying 0 defaults to the number of
          logical cores
          
          [aliases: --jobs]

Watch options:
  -w, --watch [<PATH>...]
          Watch the given files or directories for changes.
          
          If no paths are provided, the source and test directories of the
          project are watched.

      --no-restart
          Do not restart the command while it's still running

      --run-all
          Explicitly re-run all tests when a change is made.
          
          By default, only the tests of the last modified test file are
          executed.

      --rerun-failed
          Re-run only previously failed tests first when a change is made.
          
          If all previously failed tests pass, the full test suite will be run
          automatically. This is particularly useful for TDD workflows where you
          want fast feedback on failures.

      --watch-delay <DELAY>
          File update debounce delay.
          
          During the delay, incoming change events are accumulated and only once
          the delay has passed, is an action taken. Note that this does not mean
          a command will be started: if --no-restart is given and a command is
          already running, the outcome of the action will be to do nothing.
          
          Defaults to 50ms. Parses as decimal seconds by default, but using an
          integer with the `ms` suffix may be more convenient.
          
          When using --poll mode, you'll want a larger duration, or risk
          overloading disk I/O.

  -p, --port <PORT>
          Port for serving documentation

      --deployments [<DEPLOYMENTS>]
          The relative path to the `hardhat-deploy` or `forge-deploy` artifact
          directory. Leave blank for default

  -i, --include-libraries
          Whether to create docs for external libraries

Display options:
      --color <COLOR>
          The color of the log messages

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Intelligently guess whether to use color output (default)
          - always: Force color output
          - never:  Force disable color output

      --json
          Format log messages as JSON

      --md
          Format log messages as Markdown

  -q, --quiet
          Do not print log messages

  -v, --verbosity...
          Verbosity level of the log messages.
          
          Pass multiple times to increase the verbosity (e.g. -v, -vv, -vvv).
          
          Depending on the context the verbosity levels have different meanings.
          
          For example, the verbosity levels of the EVM are:
          - 2 (-vv): Print logs for all tests.
          - 3 (-vvv): Print execution traces for failing tests.
          - 4 (-vvvv): Print execution traces for all tests, and setup traces
          for failing tests.
          - 5 (-vvvvv): Print execution and setup traces for all tests,
          including storage changes and
            backtraces with line numbers.
