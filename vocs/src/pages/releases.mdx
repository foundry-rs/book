# v1.6.0-rc1 [January 22, 2026]

# Foundry v1.6.0

Foundry v1.6.0 brings **Osaka as the default EVM hardfork**, major **performance improvements** with parallelized stateless fuzzing and configurable invariant check intervals (up to 3.6x faster deep runs), enhanced **security testing** with improved reentrancy detection and time-based invariant fuzzing, and additional **Tempo blockchain integration** across forge, cast, and anvil.

We recently crossed 10,000 GitHub 🌟 — thank you to everyone who has contributed, reported issues, and helped improve Foundry!

---

## Performance

### Parallelized Stateless Fuzzing ([[#12713](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12713)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12713))

Fuzz tests now run across multiple worker threads, significantly improving execution speed on multi-core machines. Each worker maintains its own corpus and periodically syncs with a master corpus, enabling efficient parallel exploration while sharing discovered coverage. Workers automatically distribute runs evenly and aggregate results after completion.

### Invariant `check_interval` Config ([[#13133](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13133)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13133))

New `check_interval` config option controls how often invariants are asserted during deep runs:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | Only assert on the last call of each run (fastest) |
| `1` (default) | Assert after every call (current behavior, most precise) |
| `N` | Assert every N calls AND always on the last call |

**Benchmark**: With `check_interval = 10`, deep invariant runs (1×1000 depth) are **3.6x faster** (15.09s → 4.17s). Invariant checks consume ~86% of execution time in high-depth runs—reducing check frequency dramatically improves performance while still catching violations.

### Other Performance Improvements

- perf: add dist profile for smaller release binaries ([[#13097](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13097)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13097)) by [@onbjerg](https://github.com/onbjerg)
- perf: compute literals only once ([[#12716](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12716)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12716)) by [@DaniPopes](https://github.com/DaniPopes)
- perf: remove redundant allocation in receipt bloom calculation ([[#13035](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13035)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13035)) by [@marukai67](https://github.com/marukai67)

---

## Security Testing

### Improved Reentrancy Detection with `call_override` ([[#13127](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13127)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/13127))

The `call_override` invariant testing feature now correctly detects ETH transfer reentrancy vulnerabilities, including:
- **EtherStore pattern**: Classic DAO-style reentrancy where a handler sends ETH out and the attacker reenters
- **Rari Capital pattern**: Protocol-level reentrancy where external protocols send ETH to handlers

Key fixes include proper ETH transfer via journal before callback injection, clearing REVM's cached bytecode for EOA targets, and overriding calls when either caller OR target is a handler contract. Validated against a reproduction of the April 2022 Rari Capital hack.

### Time-based Invariant Fuzzing ([[#12616](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12616)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/12616))

New `max_time_delay` and `max_block_delay` invariant configs enable fuzzing of block timestamp and block number on consecutive transactions. This helps discover time-dependent vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific block timing conditions. Counterexamples now display the `vm.warp()` and `vm.roll()` calls needed to reproduce failures.

## Improved Integration

### Foundry-toolchain TypeScript Rewrite

The [`foundry-toolchain`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain) GitHub Action has been completely rewritten in TypeScript for improved maintainability and reliability. See [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

### Foundryup Rust Rewrite (Experimental)

Foundry v1.6.0 is accompanied by a new Rust rewrite of [`foundryup`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundryup) for better maintainability, testing, and compatibility. At the moment the new `foundryup` installer is still experimental, but in next releases we plan to sunset the old one and provide a much better experience for managing foundry installs.

To try out the new `foundryup` run:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/foundryup/HEAD/foundryup-init.sh | bash
foundryup
```
